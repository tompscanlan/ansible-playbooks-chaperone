Chaperone Setup on Photon
=========================
This playbook and script set intends to ease setting up to develop and install
Chaperone on Photon OS.

## Getting Started
To use Photon OS for Chaperone development, we need a few things to start with:

1. Start a Photon OS VM. For example, on VMware Fusion or Workstation.
1. Login to that VM, as root, and find its IP address for future use: `ip addr`.
1. Make sure git is available: `tdnf install -y git
1. Get the code we'll use to setup Photon: `git clone https://github.com/vmware/ansible-playbooks-chaperone chaperone`
1. Change directories so accessing the setup scripts is easier: `cd chaperone/scripts`
1. Setup Photon with all the things we need: `./photon.sh`
1. Setup the VM for develpoment as non-root user vmware: `./chaperone.sh`

## Cleaning up
After setting up, you no longer need the playbook repository cloned above,
so just remove it:
```
    cd ${HOME}
    rm -rf chaperone
```

## Login as user vmware and get the code.

1. Login to the VM as vmware and (by default) password VMware1!
1. Make the chaperone directory: `mkdir chaperone`
1. Change directories to the dev folder: `cd chaperone`
1. Initialize repo: `repo init -u https://github.com/chaperone -b master -g chaperone`

That's it! Next up is creating the CDS.
